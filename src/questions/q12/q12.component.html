        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understanding how much things cost</li>
            <li>Understanding how much change you should get</li>
            <li>Managing your own budgets, paying your own bills, and planning
                your own future purchases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This does not mean taking a bill to the post box or being able to
            hold your change.</p>
        <p>This also does not mean being able to read a bill or physically open
            a letter.</p>

            <p>‘Most days I have difficulty making decisions about bills and
                household budgets because I become very anxious and panicked. My
                partner helps me make financial decisions.’</p>
            <p>‘I always have difficulty paying for things in shops because I
                find it difficult to calculate how much things cost. My carer
                helps me understand how much I need to pay.’</p>
