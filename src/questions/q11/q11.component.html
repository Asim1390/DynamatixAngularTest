        <p>This means:</p>

            <li>Understanding how they are behaving towards you including body
                language</li>
            <li>Behaving appropriately towards them</li>
            <li>Being able to make new relationships with other people</li>
        </ul>

                I interact with new people so I do not become distressed.’</p>
