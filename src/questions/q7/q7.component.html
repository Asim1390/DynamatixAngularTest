        <p>Using the toilet means:</p>

            <li>Cleaning yourself after using the toilet</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Managing incontinence means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing the emptying of your bowel and bladder when you have
                difficulty controlling this, including if you need a collecting
                device such as a catheter or stoma bag</li>
            <li>Cleaning yourself after doing so</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This does not mean physically getting to the bathroom.</p>
