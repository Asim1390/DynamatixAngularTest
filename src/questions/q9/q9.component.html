        <h5>Examples</h5>
        <p>‘I always have difficulties listening because I am hard of hearing. I
            use 2 hearing aids to help me hear what other people are
            saying.’</p>
        <p>‘I have difficulty speaking and expressing myself due to having a
            stroke several years ago. I use a communication board to help me
            communicate with others.’</p>
