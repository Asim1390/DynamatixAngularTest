        <p>This means doing the following in your own language:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading written words and numbers both indoors and outdoors</li>
            <li>Reading signs and symbols (for example, a green exit sign on a
                door)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For this question, you must be able to see the information. Using
            braille to read is not counted as reading, and you should give more
            detail about how your condition affects your ability to read.</p>

        <!-- Question 10b -->
        <h6 class="fw-bold mt-3">Q10b Tell us about the difficulties you have
            with reading words or symbols and how you manage them.</h6>
        <p>For each difficulty, please tell us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How often you have this difficulty – tell us about both good and
                bad days</li>
            <li>What the difficulty is</li>
            <li>Why you have it, or how it relates to your condition</li>
            <li>Any aids or adaptations you use, or help you get from another
                person</li>
            <li>Any help you feel you need but do not get</li>
        </ul>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Examples</h6>
        <p>‘I am never able to read one sentence after another because I confuse
            the order of the letters and words. I use a portable scanner to help
            me understand written words more quickly.’</p>
        <p>‘I have dyslexia and need to use a yellow filter to help me to
            read.’</p>
        <p>‘Most days, I am unable to read at all because I experience double
            vision and am unable to focus. My partner reads for me when I am
            unable to do it myself.’</p>
