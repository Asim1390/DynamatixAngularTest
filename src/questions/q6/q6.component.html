        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Washing your body, limbs, face, underarms, and hair</li>
            <li>Using a normal bath or shower</li>
            <li>Getting in and out of a normal bath or shower</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do consider if you can wash or bathe safely and without being
            supervised. And consider how much time it takes you and whether you
            do it too often or not often enough.</p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold">Examples</h6>
        <p>‘For about 3 months of the year, I cannot motivate myself to bathe
            because I feel too depressed. My parents prompt me for several
            minutes every day to go and shower when I cannot motivate
            myself.’</p>
        <p>‘About 5 days a week, I have difficulty washing my lower body because
            my back is too stiff and painful. I use a shower seat so that I can
            rest my back when I shower.’</p>
