    <p>When we receive your form, we may invite you to attend an assessment with
        a health professional. This will give you the chance to tell us more
        about how your health condition or disability affects your daily
        life.</p>

    <p class="fw-bold">If we invite you to an assessment, you must attend. If
        you do not attend and you do not have a good reason, your PIP claim will
        end. If you currently get Disability Living Allowance (DLA) this will
        stop.</p>
    <p>However, if you have given us enough information, an assessment may not
        be needed.</p>

    <h5 class="fw-bold">Attending an assessment with a health professional</h5>
    <p>If you are invited to an assessment appointment with a health
        professional:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>you may be able to have someone with you</li>
        <li>tell us if you need an interpreter, for example, British Sign
            Language</li>
        <li>you will need to have 2 forms of identity with you, like your
            passport or UK utility bill</li>
        <li>the health professional will talk to you about how your health
            condition or disability affects your daily life; it is not a
            physical examination</li>
        <li>the assessment will take about an hour</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tell us on this form about any help you (or someone who may accompany
        you) would need if you have to go for a face-to-face assessment. This
        will help us meet your needs. For example, tell us if you or they:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>cannot get up and down stairs</li>
        <li>have difficulty travelling or using public transport</li>
        <li>have communication needs, and what support you or they will
            need</li>
        <li>need accessible toilets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please be specific about the needs you or they have.</p>
